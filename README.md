# Automated Weapon-detection using YOLOv8 and Streamlit
## INTRODUCTION
The proliferation of online content has brought about unprecedented opportunities for communication, collaboration, and expression. However, there exists a major challenge of ensuring a safe and secure online environment for all users. One significant concern is the presence of potentially harmful content, including images depicting weapons or violence, which can pose serious risks to individuals and communities. To address this challenge, these systems leverage advanced technologies, such as deep learning algorithms and image processing techniques, to 
detect and mitigate the impact of harmful content in digital spaces. Automated weapon detection is a computer vision technique that aims to identify and localize weapons in images and videos and applying blurring techniques to obscure them, thereby enhancing privacy and safety online.
##  Current Scope
To create an automated weapon detection using image processing and blurring system for online content moderation that makes use of deep learning techniques. This entails
gathering a variety of datasets, honing object detection models through training and refinement, putting in place real-time content analysis and moderation systems,
combining weapon detection with blurring techniques, verifying and testing system performance, and dealing with deployment-related issues
